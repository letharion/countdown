Countdown provides the ability to create any number of countdowns, each with it's own formatter settings, and integrates these with the context module, both as block reactions and before/after conditions.

It uses the jQuery countdown library (http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html) for a lot of it's functionality, and depends on the Drupal module (http://drupal.org/project/jquery_countdown/) to provide the library. As the countdown uses javascript, it's reverse proxy friendly.

Example of how to use:
1. To go Structure >> Countdowns.
2. Enter a target time for a new countdown, change the output format from the default if you want to.
3. Save. You will now have a block that you can place anywhere you want.
4. To use with context, create a new context, add a countdown condition, pick the new timer, select the "Before" option.
5. Add two reactions, the "Powered by Drupal" block, and the timer block itself.
6. The Drupal and timer blocks, will now only show up until the timer runs to 0.
